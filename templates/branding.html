        <br/><br/> + You may use our logo and banner in your work, but please do not use the logo or banner to endorse your own work which has no relation with {{APPNAME}}.
        <br/><br/> + Both the logo and banner are trademarks of knotters.org.
        <br/><br/> + Only the links pointing to knotters.org are allowed to be used with the logo and banner wherever you utilize them.
        <br/><br/> + DO NOT make any changes or modifications to the assets (For example - DO NOT change the color to adjust to your environment).
        <br/><br/> + We have provided our logo and banner with and without a background, therefore, you should not feel the need to change the background color of the logo or banner.
        <br/><br/> + DO NOT distort, resize, reshape, strech, shrink, crop or otherwise alter the logo or banner in anyway which changes its original form.
        <br/><br/> + The assets contain most of the sizes that you may need to use in your work.
        <br/><br/> + Always use the original size of the logo and banner though whichever size you use from the assets.
        <br/><br/> + We have provided both light and dark variants of the logo and banner, you may use any of the variants without modification.
        <br/><br/> + Wherever you plan to use our assets, please make sure that the asset is used in a way that is consistent with the brand, and should always infer that it is a brand element of knotters.org only.
        <br/><br/> + Your use of the assets should not give the impression that you associate/partner with knotters.org, unless permitted explicitly by knotters.org.
