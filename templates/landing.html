                    <h5>Why so?</h5>

                    This is the stage at which starting a project with {{APPNAME}} gives your idea a certain amount of exposure, a head start,
                    a profile, a face, a room on internet, a family to your project to-be. We call that family <em>{{APPNAME}} Community</em>.
                    And it's fruitful.

                    <h4><span class="tertiary">If you have, then</span></h4>
                    There's always a need for any project to be in the public eye. Social networking sites could be helpfull, but those 
                    only provide exposure to the deliverability of your project, not to the project itself. As mentioned previously, having 
                    an official profile of your project, in whichever domain it may be, gives it a recognizable face, a room on internet, and
                    again, a family. {{APPNAME}} provides all of these to your project.

            To review and take action on verified projects submissions, a category of users at Knotters are called the moderators.
            The descision taken by a moderator for a project decides its future. If approved, the project enters our world.
            If rejected, then the creator gets a few chances to resubmit the same for review to a different moderator.
            No creator or moderator knows each other during review process. The project assigned to a moderator is assigned 
            according to their area of expertise, which is interpreted from their overall contribution record on Knotters.
            The moderator helps a project reach new heights if approved. Moderator is like a project mentor.

            (which are enough in numbers). For verified projects, you can add your own license if the default ones doesn't suit you.
            If you don't understand licenses and their importance, you can go with the default selected license for your projects.

            If you've read about how a moderator gets projects to review, then you could probably interpret the importance of 
            XP of topics for a moderator. As the submitted projects have a category, the associated topics with that particular
            category play an important role in assignment of a moderator.

            Moderators hold an elite position on our platform.
            They perform superlative tasks, govern their approved project's growth, and also moderate submissions of competitions as well!<br/>
            You can, if you want to, become a moderator too. It is a selective process, and depending upon your performance and
            experience at Knotters, we'll reach out to you for the opportunity.
