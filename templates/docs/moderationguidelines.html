       <h5>For creators</h5>
       <li>
          Verified Projects on our platform focus on overall effect they cause to their surroundings, the people who contribute to them, and those who create them.
          You should, before submitting a project for verification, be very clear and focused regarding the need of your project.
       </li><br/>
       <li>
          Choosing between a Quick project or Verified project should not only be a concern of the features each of the categories provide, but also 
          what your project intends to achieve. For example - A simple note making app project is a good fit to be a quick project, not verified one.
          However, if the same note making app project intends to revolutionize the way people take notes (maybe using AI,ML), then this intention needs to be
          made clear while categorizing it as a verified project.
       </li><br/>
       <li>
         If you are submitting project for verification, make sure the details and language is very clear. We are not disallowing informal language here,
         however, make sure you focus on the description and intention of your project, and not on amusing the moderator.
       </li><br/>
       <li>
         If your verified project is approved, you will be notified via email, and you'll receive an invitation to join {{APPNAME}} organization on GitHub (if not already a member).
         A team will be created including you and the moderator. You are advised to also join our Discord server to stay updated on the progress of your project and interact with moderator and others.
         Your project will get a verified profile on {{APPNAME}}, and you can then edit its details as you wish, and start posting snapshots.
         Your project's moderator can also post snapshots for the project.
       </li><br/>
       <li>
          Before submitting a project for verification for the first time, go through <a href="{{URLS.TYPE|params:'communityguidelines'}}">community guidelines</a> and <a href="{{URLS.TYPE|params:'legal-faqs'}}">community FAQs</a> as well.
       </li><br/>
       <li>
          Core projects are currently reserved for organizations/companies/club accounts only (collectively called management accounts on {{APPNAME}}).
       </li><br/>
       <li>
          Core projects have a budget set by the manager (creator), and the source code remains private at {{APPNAME}}.
          The manager can set their moderator and in this process, the moderator and creator can see each other while project is being reviewed.
       </li><br/>
       <li>
          Moderator if approves the project, then they can invite others or others may request to work on the core project. Core projects also have profiles like verified and quick projects.
          <b>The budget of a core project cannot be decreased once it is approved.</b>
       </li><br/>
        <h5>{% trans "For moderators" %}</h5>
        <li>
          Verified Projects on our platform focus on overall effect they cause to their surroundings, the people who contribute to them, and those who moderate them.
          You, the moderator, should, before approving/rejecting a project from verification, be very clear, neutral, thoughtful and understanding regarding the idea of project, and the message of the creator.
       </li><br/>
        <li>
          The project under your review should be checked for any inappropriate content first, and if found, the project should be rejected immediately.
          You can read our <a href="{{URLS.TYPE|params:'communityguidelines'}}">community guidelines</a> and <a href="{{URLS.TYPE|params:'legal-faqs'}}">community FAQs</a> on how to handle inappropriate content. If you find any content that is inappropriate, please report it too.
       </li><br/>
        <li>
         While deciding the future of the project under your review, do not consider it as a liability of the creator only.
         The moderator also needs to understand the need of the project, and the impact it will have on the community and domain it intends to target.
         For example - A simple note making app project is a good fit to be a quick project, not verified one.
         However, if the same note making app project intends to revolutionize the way people take notes (maybe using AI,ML, Data science), then this intention is needed
         to be considered while deciding the future of the project.
       </li><br/>
       <li>
          Moderator, if approves the project, can invite others or others may request to work on the project on Github team.
