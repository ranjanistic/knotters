     <h5>For participants</h5>
     <ul>
      <li>
        Participating in a competition does not guarantee that your submission will be included in the results as well. There are several reasons for which your submission may get rejected which will be mentioned in this page, keep reading.
      </li>
      <li>
	Some competitions may charge a registration fee for participation. Even though anyone can participate with or without paying any fee, these competitions limit the eligibility for prize to the paying participants only. Certificates are still allotted with or without paying registration fee in these type of competitions.
      </li>
      <li>
	Most of the competitions Require participants to submit a source code based submission. For these kind of submissions, participants are required to submit a valid URL pointing towards the end product or source code repository (whichever is required by a particular competition) owned by the participants only. If in any case our moderators find that your submission is not authentic, your submission will be rejected and won’t be eligible for any certificate or prize.
      </li>
      <li>
	There must be clear description in your submission repository or page about whatever is required by the competition. And of course, the link to your submission should be publicly accessible for the rest of your life. If the repository is hosted on GitHub, then inviting knottersbot as a collaborator on GitHub can help speed up your judgement process.
      </li>
      <li>
	For a repository, the commits made should only be contained in the duration of competition itself. Any commits made before or after the duration of competition will lead your submission to rejection. The commits should contain proper code changes, and not just ‘Added files via upload’ commits. Every commit should be well described about the changes made.
      </li>
      <li>
	When you’re ready to finally submit your submission, make sure it is saved first and verify it. We won’t be responsible for unsaved submissions made by you. Once submitted, you cannot undo anything.
      </li>
      <li>
	We show leniency with participants who submit late, however, late submissions will always be vulnerable to rejection. The late submission window remains open till moderators do their job, and we have no control over it. Regardless, it is encouraged that you submit on time, as late submissions are rejected most of the times.
      </li>
      <li>
	In ultra-rare conditions, un-submitted participation may also get considered for judgement. However, you should always avoid reaching this stage.
      </li>
      <li>
	Results declaration procedure takes at most 15 days, so you should remain patient after competition ends. The declared results should be considered final and not to be questioned (Trust the process). Claiming points (XP) from your results can only be done by you for your profile, don’t depend on us for that. The rejected submissions are not included in results.
      </li>
      <li>
	Certificates are made available shortly after results declaration. The certificate link however, is readily available even without the certificate itself. Your account name is used on the certificate, so make sure it is correct before participating, it cannot be changed after your certificate is generated.
      </li>
      <li>
	The prizes are distributed to the winner(s) under 28 days from results declaration. Winners are reached out personally via email, and are further coordinated towards the prizes.
      </li>
      <li>
	It is encouraged that participants share their submissions on other social sites and tag Knotters with it. (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.)
