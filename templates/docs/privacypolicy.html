    <h4 id="intro">Introduction</h4>
    <p>
    For the content on this page, <br/>
    <strong>Knotters, Knotters platform, Knotters Community, Knotters Website, Knotters Web Application </strong> shall represent the synonyms of the same entity - Knotters.<br/>
    <strong>Our platform, our website, this platform, this website</strong> shall refer to the Knotters platform.<br/>
    <strong>User, you, person, people(plural)</strong> shall refer to the person using our platform and reading this document, unless specified explicitly.<br/>
    <strong>3rd party service(s), oauth service(s)</strong> shall refer to the services which are not associated with Knotters in any direct way, but we may use them for specific cases.<br/>
    </p>
    <h4 id="personal-info-means">What do we mean by "personal information"?</h4>
    <p>
    For us, "personal information" means information which either directly identifies you (like your name, email address, or academic information) or can be reasonably linked or combined to identify you (like third party oauth account(s)). We’ll always tell you what personal information we’re collecting from you, irrespective of whether the 3rd party service tells you what info we are collecting, or not. Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."
    If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.
    </p>
    <h4 id="personal-info-collection">How do we learn information about you?</h4>
    <p>
    We learn information about you when you interact with our platform via following ways, but not limited to, <br/>
    <strong>Creating an account :</strong> Using email address or 3rd party oauth services<br/>
    <strong>Engaging in project(s) :</strong> By submission, contribution, moderation<br/>
    <strong>Engaging in competition(s) :</strong> By Partipation, moderator and or judgment in a competition.<br/>
    <strong>Interacting with other services :</strong> The services which are a part of our platform.<br/>
    </p>
    <h4 id="personal-info-management">What do we do with your information once we have it?</h4>
    <p>
    When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission. By default, any sensitive information provided by you intentionally and/or unintentionally, is kept private, and relevant opting out settings are provided wherever possible.
    You can always choose to have your identity on this platform be removed, and by removal we mean permamanent inaccess to your identity on this platform. This action unlinks your personally identifying IDs (such as email address, or 3rd party outh provided IDs) from your identity on this platform.
    However, the information of your profile remains in an inactive state. You should understand the difference between the terms that we use on our platform : <b>Identity</b> and <b>Profile</b><br/><br/>
    <strong>Identity :</strong> Your identity on our platform is the entity which is presumably linked directly to your identity in reality, using your email address (provided directly by you on signup, or via oauth providers you may use). This entity is the epicenter of all activities you perform on our platform.
    When you choose to delete your account, this entity and the associated IDs get deleted unrecoverably, implying that nothing on our platform will point out to your real identity, on the event you choose to delete your account.<br/>
    <strong>Profile :</strong> Your profile is the entity which is directly linked to your identity (previous entity) on this platform, implying that this entity is indirectly linked to your real life identity. This entity is generated for you to use our services, and for other people on this platform, this entity indicates your presence.
    When you choose to delete your account, this entity does not get deleted in any way (unlike the previous entity). Your profile entity gets unlinked from your identity on this platform, implying that it does no longer indirectly point to your identity in real life (it never did directly).
    The Profile entity does not contain any personally identifiable info about your real identity. Therefore, you should not worry about the preservance of this entity after you chose to delete your account.
    The reason why your profile entity doesn't get removed like your personal identity is because of the associated services (projects, competition submissions/results, community interactions) which cannot get removed for the sake of other people on our platform. However, your personal info (name, email, etc.) is immediately replaced from these associated services,
    generally by - a successor or a pseudonym. The specific replacement depends upon the type of associated service.

    <h4 id="additional-info">Things you should know.</h4>
    <p>
    We may use cookies, clear GIFs, third party web analytics, device information, and IP addresses for functionality and to better understand people interaction with us and amongst themselves on our community platform. However, you can control individual cookie preferences and opt-out of web analytics and optimization tools.
    We may allow you to contribute funds to specific projects being developed by our community, or make donations in support of our public and charitable programs. These transactions are <strong>often handled by third party vendors</strong>.<br/> 
    <strong>Payment Processing :</strong> Except for payments made by check, money order, and direct debit, and wire transfers, we do not receive any financial information, which is transmitted from you to the named third party vendor for processing (e.g., Braintree, PayPal, Bitpay, Razorpay, Stripe).
    <br/>
